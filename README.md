# Oussama Shop

**Oussama Shop** is an e-commerce platform I developed using the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) to provide a robust, scalable, and responsive user experience.

- **MongoDB** serves as the primary NoSQL database, efficiently handling product data storage and retrieval.
- **Express.js** powers the backend with a flexible and lightweight server-side framework.
- **Angular** delivers a dynamic and user-friendly frontend interface.
- **Node.js** ensures high performance and scalability on the server side.

In addition to the MEAN stack version, I also built an alternative version using **Sequelize** and a SQL-based database to offer flexibility in backend data management.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an early-stage version and does not yet follow best practices.  
> For access to the final version with clean architecture and production-ready standards, feel free to contact me.
